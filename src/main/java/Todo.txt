Improvment ideas:

Allow selection of filename on save (overwrite?)
Allow removal of specific elements from the undo stack?
- perhaps with thumbnail image of what stack items look like?
- perhaps with names for some items like "background", "loaded image"?
- if implemented, perhaps "load image" should not clear out the undo/redo stacks?
